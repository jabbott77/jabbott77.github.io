                <p>This image depicts the devastation that is occurring in the southern and southeastern areas, towards Chonburi, of Thailand. 
                This typhoon has strong winds that has caused mass destruction to where all people in the vicinity should take shelter immediately.
                Typhoons are incredibly dangerous and need to be taken seriously. There are also many other things in this world that are dangerous
                such as sharks, lasers, laser sharks, dragons, snakes, snakes dressing up as dragons, dragons dressing up as snakes(except I don't know
                why they would want to be snakes because they already have arms and can breath fire), things that fly like flies that can hurt people,
                Communism, Sith Lords, Communist Sith Lords, weightlifing T-Rexs, and obesity. That's all the things that I think are dangerous in this
                world so be careful and don't pretend I didn't warn you.</p>
